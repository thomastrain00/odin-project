    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A crêpe or crepe is a very thin type of pancake. Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: sweet crêpes or savoury galettes. They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as cheese, fruit, vegetables, meats, and a variety of spreads. Crêpes can also be flambéed, such as in crêpes Suzette.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>all purpose flour</li> 
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>melted butter</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>vanilla extract </li>
        <li>heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>cream cheese</li>
        <li>mixed berries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>  
    <ol>
        <li>You'll just make your crepe batter, by putting all the ingredients into the blender and pulsing till smooth. Refrigerate the batter for an hour or more, though I've also skipped this and only refrigerated for about 15 minutes, just to let some of the bubbles settle.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup crepe batter into a large greased saute pan, or a crepe maker. And cook for about 1 minute, then flip the crepe over and cook the other side for about 30 seconds. Repeat with additional batter.</li>
        <li>Sauté up your berries with a little sugar, till they get a little juicy and let the sauce thicken just a little bit. Stir together the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla extract, then in another bowl, whip the cream until it's nice and fluffy. Fold them together to make a nice fluffy mixture.</li>
        <li>Then take one crepe, spread the middle down with the cream cheese filling. Then add some berries over the top of the cream cheese mixture. Roll the crepes up, and top with additional berries, and some powdered sugar and dig in!</li>
    </ol>
